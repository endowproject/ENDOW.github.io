Among many other tasks, the assistant director of ENDOW, [Daniel Redhead](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/staff/daniel-redhead/index.html), oversees the creation and maintenance of the ENDOW database, which will in time be a resource for the broader scientific community. To prepare the database, we have designed a workflow that flexibly accomodates the complex, longitudinal structure of the data. To ensure that our workflow is as reproducible and transparent as possible, work at every stage of the process is done through scripting in R and version controlled using git and GitHub.

We are assisted in the massive task of managing the ENDOW dataset by researchers based in the [Department of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/index.html) at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index.html), with advice from [Silke Atmaca](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/staff/silke-atmaca/index.html), [Bret Beheim](https://www.babeheim.com/), and [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/), and the essential efforts of a team of HIWIs (Anastassiya Bublikova, Enzo Lima, Nikkin Devaraju).
