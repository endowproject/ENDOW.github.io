The ENDOW project is a collaborative network of social scientists interested in cross-cultural comparative work.

We are bringing together anthropologists and other social scientists working primarily in rural – and rapidly changing – communities around the world to undertake research that explores key social and environmental dimensions of the human condition -- see the [fieldsites page](https://endowproject.github.io/fieldsites/) to see where we're working. 

We are working to build the networks and infrastructure (including survey protocols, database architectures, and analytical tools) that will facilitate meaningful, productive comparisons -- see the [data management page](https://endowproject.github.io/data-management/) for more on some of these efforts.

Right now, our primary efforts are aimed at understanding "Economic Network Dynamics and the Origins of Wealth (Inequality)" (hence the acronym ENDOW) -- see the [projects page](https://endowproject.github.io/projects/) for more details on our past and current projects. 

Watch this space for more on our work, and please [reach out](mailto:endowproject@gmail.com) if you're interested in getting involved.
