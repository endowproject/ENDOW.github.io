The ENDOW project is a collaborative network of social scientists interested in cross-cultural comparative work.

We are bringing together anthropologists and other social scientists working primarily in rural – and rapidly changing – communities around the world to explore various aspects of the human condition.

We are working to build the networks and infrastructure (including survey protocols, database architectures, and analytical tools) that will facilitate undertake meaningful, productive comparisons -- see the [database page](endowproject.github.io/database) for more on our efforts.

Right now, our primary efforts are aimed at understanding "Economic Network Dynamics and the Origins of Wealth (Inequality)" (hence the acronym ENDOW!) -- see the [projects page](endowproject.github.io/projects) for more details on our past and current projects. 

Watch this space for more on our work, and please [reach out](endowproject@gmail.com) if you're interested in getting involved!
